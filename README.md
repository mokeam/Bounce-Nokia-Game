# Bounce
This game was inspired by a game series that was published by Nokia called Bounce. 
In the original Bounce game the player controls a red ball through many levels in a 2D side-scrolling game world. The player controls a red ball with the requirements to go through all hoops. The enemies come in the form of blue 'spiky' objects. 

We have implemented this game similar to the above description of the original Nokia game with some modifications.
